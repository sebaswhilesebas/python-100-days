##What was the total bill? $124.56
##How much tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
##How many people to split the bill? 7
#If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip. 

#Each person should pay (150.00 / 5) * 1.12 = 33.6
#Format the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60

#Tip: There are 2 ways to round a number. You might have to do some Googling to solve this.ðŸ’ª
